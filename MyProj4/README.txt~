This is my project3 and it implements boolean expressions and if statements.
NOTE: there is no 'else' statment since that was not specifically instructed. 

'true' is like a C true and is therefore equal to 1.
'false' is similar in that it equals 0.
Both 'true' and 'false' are lower case fully spelled out words.

Boolean operators are exactly like in C, as are comparison operators.

All quoted strings are printed with a newline built in; this may change in the future


There are no quirks that I have found. 

Syntax:
	printing quoted strings is very straight forward, simply type a quoted string:
		"some quoted string to print"
	
	if statements are similar to those in C, just no else:
	if(4<5){
		if(i == 9){
			i = i+1
			"success"
		}
	}
